The Add-on integrates with Google Sheets™ and provides functionality to convert numeric values into their text equivalents (amounts in words).

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data (if any) we process, how we use it, and what rights you have regarding your data.

The Add-on's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the **Google API Services User Data Policy**, including the **Limited Use requirements**.

By using the Service, You agree to the processing of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 1. Interpretation and Definitions

*   **Add-on:** The software product "{{objAppName.en}}", installed by the user from the Google Workspace Marketplace™ and operating within the Google Sheets™ environment.
*   **Google Sheets™:** The spreadsheet service provided by Google LLC, in which the Add-on operates.
*   **Google Account:** Your Google account used to access Google Sheets™ and install the Add-on.
*   **Company:** bvstud.io, the developer of the Add-on.
*   **Service:** The functionality provided by the Add-on.
*   **User Data:** Information processed by the Add-on, namely:
    *   **Numeric Data:** Numbers from cells in your Google Sheet that you specify for conversion via the `PRICETOTEXT()` function or the Add-on interface.
    *   **Add-on Settings:** Your chosen language and currency for conversion, stored using standard Google Apps Script mechanisms (e.g., PropertiesService), associated with your document or user.
*   **Personal Data:** Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. In the context of using the Add-on, we **do not actively collect** and **do not store** personal data such as your name, address, etc., on our servers. The only potential exception is your email address if you contact us for support.
*   **You:** The individual or legal entity using the Add-on.

### 2. What Information We Process and How We Use It

**The "{{objAppName.en}}" Add-on is designed with minimal data collection as a priority:**

*   **Numeric Data from your Sheets:**
    *   **Purpose:** Solely to perform the core function of the Add-on – converting numbers to text (amounts in words) according to the selected language and currency settings.
    *   **Processing:** This processing occurs **locally** within your Google Sheets™ environment using Google Apps Script. **We do not transfer, store, or analyze the content of your sheets on our servers.**
*   **Add-on Settings (language, currency):**
    *   **Purpose:** To remember your preferences and ensure the conversion function works correctly in subsequent uses.
    *   **Storage:** These settings are stored using the Google Apps Script `PropertiesService`, which is associated with your Google Account or the specific Google Sheets™ document you are working in. This data resides within Google's infrastructure, not on the Company's servers.
*   **Google Account Information:**
    *   The Add-on operates within the context of your Google Account, which is necessary for integration with Google Sheets™ and the execution of Apps Script. We **do not gain** access to your password or other sensitive account information. We may only see your email address when you grant the Add-on necessary permissions during installation (a standard requirement for Google Workspace Add-ons) or if you contact us with a support request.
*   **Usage Data:**
    *   We **do not collect** detailed usage information such as IP addresses, browser types, unique device identifiers, or page visit history **through our Add-on**. Google may collect certain anonymous usage statistics for Marketplace add-ons for its own purposes, governed by Google's policies.

**We DO NOT use your data for:**

*   Targeted advertising.
*   Selling to third parties.
*   Analyzing financial information in your spreadsheets.

### 3. Data Storage and Transfer

*   As stated above, **numeric data from your sheets is not stored** by the Company. Processing is temporary and occurs within your Google environment.
*   **Add-on Settings** are stored within Google's infrastructure using standard Apps Script mechanisms and are linked to your account or document.
*   We do not transfer your information (numeric data, settings) to third parties, except where necessary to comply with the law or respond to requests from public authorities.

### 4. Disclosure of Your Data

We may disclose information only under the following circumstances:

*   **Law Enforcement:** If required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court).
*   **Legal Obligations:** To protect and defend the rights or property of the Company, prevent wrongdoing, or protect against legal liability.
*   **Business Transactions:** In the unlikely event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale involving the Company, your data (if any is held by us, e.g., support communication) may be transferred. We will provide notice before such a transfer occurs.

**We DO NOT transfer your data to business partners, affiliates, or for marketing purposes.**

### 5. Security of Your Data

*   The security of your data is important to us. Since the primary processing occurs within your Google Sheets™ environment, security largely depends on the security measures of the Google Cloud Platform and your own Google Account.
*   We use standard Google Apps Script development practices to minimize risks.
*   We do not store sensitive data on our own servers, reducing potential attack vectors.
*   However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

### 6. Your Rights and Data Management

*   You control the data within your Google Sheets.
*   You can change or delete Add-on settings via its interface (if provided) or reset them by reinstalling the Add-on.
*   To stop any data processing by the Add-on, you can:
    *   Cease using the `PRICETOTEXT()` function.
    *   **Uninstall the Add-on** from your Google Sheets™. This can be done via the `Extensions` -> `Add-ons` -> `Manage add-ons` menu. Uninstalling the Add-on will revoke the permissions granted to it.
*   If you have contacted support and wish for your communication history to be deleted, please contact us.
