# Terms of Service for "{{objAppName.en}}"

**Last updated:** Apr 9, 2025

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before installing and using the "{{objAppName.en}}" add-on for Google Sheets™ ("Add-on", "Service") developed by **bvstud.io** ("Company", "We", "Us", "Our").

By installing or using the Add-on, you ("User", "You") agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not install or use the Add-on.

### 1. Description of Service

The "{{objAppName.en}}" Add-on is an extension for Google Sheets™ that provides the `PRICETOTEXT()` function and an interface for converting numeric values into their text equivalents (amounts in words) in various languages and for different currencies (currently supporting Ukrainian Hryvnia, US Dollars, Russian Rubles).

### 2. License to Use

*   **Grant of License:** We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, personal license to install and use the Add-on solely for its intended purpose – converting numbers to text within your Google Sheets™ spreadsheets.
*   **Restrictions:** This license is granted to you personally and is non-transferable. You may not:
    *   Modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based upon the Add-on.
    *   Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Add-on (including Google Apps Scripts).
    *   Remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the Add-on.
    *   Use the Add-on for any illegal purpose or in a manner that violates the rights of third parties.
    *   Sublicense, sell, distribute, or otherwise commercialize the Add-on without our express written consent.
    *   Use the Add-on in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair Google's services or the Add-on itself.

### 3. Intellectual Property

The Add-on, including its code, design, graphics, text, functionality, and the "{{objAppName.en}}" trademark, is the intellectual property of bvstud.io and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. These Terms do not grant you any ownership rights to the Add-on, other than the limited license to use it.

### 4. Cost and Payment

Currently, the "{{objAppName.en}}" Add-on is provided **free of charge**. We reserve the right to introduce paid features or change the pricing model in the future. Any such changes will be communicated in advance.

### 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

*   The Add-on is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied.
*   We **do not warrant** that:
    *   The Add-on will function uninterrupted, error-free, or be available at all times. The operation of the Add-on depends on the stability and availability of Google Sheets™ and Google Apps Script services.
    *   The results of the number-to-text conversion will be absolutely accurate in all possible cases (e.g., for extremely large numbers, specific formats, or non-standard language rules). While we strive for maximum accuracy, errors or inaccuracies are possible.
    *   The Add-on will be compatible with all future versions of Google Sheets™ or other add-ons.
*   Your use of the Add-on is at your sole risk. You are fully responsible for verifying the conversion results, especially in critical financial or legal documents.

### 6. Limitation of Liability

*   To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company (bvstud.io), its owners, employees, or affiliates **be liable** for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including, but not limited to:
    *   Loss of profits, data, goodwill, use, or other intangible losses.
    *   Damages resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Add-on.
    *   Damages resulting from errors or inaccuracies in the conversion results provided by the Add-on.
    *   Damages resulting from interruptions in Google's services.
    *   Damages resulting from unauthorized access to your data (although the Add-on does not store your data on our servers, security depends on your Google Account and Google Sheets™).
*   This limitation of liability applies whether the claim is based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, even if we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.

### 7. Termination

*   You may terminate these Terms at any time by uninstalling the Add-on from your Google Sheets™ account.
*   We may terminate or suspend your license to use the Add-on immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
*   We also reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Add-on (or any part thereof) at any time.

### 8. Privacy Policy

Your use of the Add-on is also governed by our [Privacy Policy](en/privacy-policy.md), which describes how we handle (or, more accurately, do not handle) your data. Please review it.

### 9. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide notice (e.g., by updating the "Last updated" date). By continuing to use the Add-on after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.

### 10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or the use of the Add-on shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Kyiv, Ukraine.
